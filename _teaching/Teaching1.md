Since 2023, I followed Professor Haidong Lu to the Institute for Translational Brain Research, Fudan University. During this period, I have contributed to guiding first- and second-year graduate students through foundational coursework and hands-on projects, covering areas such as visual neuroscience, neuroimaging methodologies, and data processing techniques.

In parallel, I developed and maintained a public Python-based data analysis platform, designed for intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) and fluorescence imaging workflows. To ensure accessibility, I created an accompanying tutorial demo [accessible here](https://github.com/adolescent/Lulab_OI_Infrastructure/tree/main/Tutorial/FC_Analysis_Demo), designed to enhance reproducibility in imaging-related analyses.
