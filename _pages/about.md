About Me
======
I am a Ph.D. candidate in neuroscience at Beijing Normal Universityâ€™s State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, where I conduct research under the mentorship of Dr. Haidong Lu. My degree is expected to be conferred in June 2025.    

During my doctoral research, I employed non-human primate (macaque) models to investigate the ventral visual pathway, focusing on cortical areas V1, V2, and V4. My thesis work specifically explores how neuronal ensembles in V1 and V2 during spontaneous states. I primarily employed two-photon calcium imaging for neuroimaging, complemented by intrinsic signal optical imaging (ISOI) in my research.

From 2023, I studied at Institute for Translational Brain Research, Fudan University, Shanghai. During these times, I learned how to build up a labatory from start, and learned the basic operation of whole-brain fluorence imaging, ISOI and EEG recording on mice. 




My future interest
